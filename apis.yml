      The Datadog API is an HTTP REST API. The API uses resource-oriented URLs
      to call the API, uses status codes to indicate the success or failure of
      requests, returns JSON from all requests, and uses standard HTTP response
      codes. Use the Datadog API to access the Datadog platform
      programmatically.
